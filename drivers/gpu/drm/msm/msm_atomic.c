/**
 * msm_atomic_helper_commit_modeset_enables - modeset commit to enable outputs
 * @dev: DRM device
 * @old_state: atomic state object with old state structures
 *
 * This function enables all the outputs with the new configuration which had to
 * be turned off for the update.
 *
 * For compatibility with legacy crtc helpers this should be called after
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_planes(), which is what the default commit function
 * does. But drivers with different needs can group the modeset commits together
 * and do the plane commits at the end. This is useful for drivers doing runtime
 * PM since planes updates then only happen when the CRTC is actually enabled.
